<!-- Changing a model in one controller, should reflect that change in other sibling controllers as well -->
<!--
Disadvantage:
https://www.accelebrate.com/blog/effective-strategies-avoiding-watches-angularjs/
Watches ($scope.$watch) suffer a performance penalty because watchers are added to the watch list and they must be re-evaluated with each run of the $digest loop.
When the value being observed by the watch changes, the function registered with the watch executes synchronously, locking the web browser user interface temporarily.

So better use event broadcasting.
$rootScope.$broadcast() from a controller - event dispatches from rootScope to all scopes down the scope chain
You can listen to that event, using $scope.$on with in your controller
