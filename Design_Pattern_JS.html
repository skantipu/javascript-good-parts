  Design Patterns in JavaScript
  1) Revealing Module Pattern.
    -Provides modularity - keeps your piece of code independent of other components
    -Does not pollute the global name space
    -Provides better data encapsulation - you can only expose public methods and hide all private properties
    -Disadv: Cannot access private properties (methods/variables that are not exposed), so difficult to write unit tests on them.

  2) Observer Pattern
    In Angular - you can use $scope.$broadcast (dispathces an event downward the scope chain), $scope.$emit (dispatches an event upward the scope chain) for
    sending out events, and $scope.$on for listening to events.

    In JS, you can use the below.

    Disadv: As number of watchers increases, it affects performance.

 3) Singleton Pattern
    The Singleton Pattern limits the number of instances of a particular object to just ONE. This single instance is called the singleton.
    You can instantiate the object only once.

    Ex: One example is using an office printer. If there are ten people in an office, and they all use one printer, ten computers share one printer

    In AngularJS, Singletons are prevalent, the most notable being services, factories, and providers. Since they maintain state and provides resource accessing,
    creating two instances defeats the point of a shared service/factory/provider.

    Disadv: Race conditions occur in multi-threaded applications when more than one thread tries to access the same resource.
    Singletons are susceptible to race conditions, such that if no instance were initialized first, two threads could then create two objects instead of
    returning and instance. This defeats the purpose of a singleton.
    Therefore, developers must be privy to synchronization when implementing singletons in multithreaded applications.
    In Java, you can use 'synchronized' block and you can keep shared resources.

    The good news is that JavaScript is single threaded; this means that solutions will generally work well with "shared" variables, i.e. no mutex locks are required.

            //OBSERVER pattern (Source: https://scotch.io/bar-talk/4-javascript-design-patterns-you-should-know)

            function Observer() {
              this.notify = function(i) {
                console.log("Observer " + i + " is notifed");
              }
            }

            function Subject() {
              this.observers = [];
              this.subscribeObserver = function(observer) {

                var index = this.observers.indexOf(observer);
                if(index > -1) {
                  this.observers.splice(index, 1);
                }
              }
              this.notifyObserver = function(observer) {
                var index = this.observers.indexOf(observer) + 1;
                observer.notify(index);
              }
              this.notifyAllObservers = function() {
                for(var i = 0; i < this.observers.length; i++){

            var obs1 = new Observer();

            var obs3 = new Observer();

            sub.subscribeObserver(obs1);
            sub.subscribeObserver(obs2);

            //Singleton Pattern (http://www.dofactory.com/javascript/singleton-design-pattern)

            var Singleton = (function () {
              var instance;

              function createInstance() {
                var object = new Object("I am the instance");
                return object;
              }

              return {
                getInstance: function () {
                  if (!instance) {
                    instance = createInstance();
                  }
                  return instance;
                }
              };
            })();

            function run() {

              var instance1 = Singleton.getInstance();
              var instance2 = Singleton.getInstance();

              console.log("Same instance? " + (instance1 === instance2));
            }

            run();

          }
