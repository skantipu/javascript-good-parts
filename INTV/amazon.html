        1. two arrays sorted, find common elements
        2. i/p: 121  o/p: 11 12 11, i/p: 1121  o/p: 21 12 11   count/number only if it's consecutive
        3. debounce - do not have backend call for a span of 400ms -- type abc (within 400ms) only one call, there has to be a gap of 400ms between current type and previous for call to BE
        4. copy object to other object - without using _.clone
        5. nested views, controllers - a page, common left pane, you should load different views on the right (ui-router, state based routing)
        6. find duplicates in an arrays, and keep it in another array. I/p: [a,b,c,d,c,a]  o/p: [a,c]

      Given 2 arrays, write function which would give the Union and Intersection Set operations. You can’t use any inbuilt data structures or functions provided by the language which would do the operations.(example Sets, Maps etc.. in java language)
      A = [2,1,1,4,2,3,7,7,7]
      B = [5,1,2,6,8,5,5,2]

      Intersection = [1,2]
      Union = [2,1,3,5,4,6,7,8]

      Union = []


      Union Result = findUniques in A (which are not present in B) + whole B array
        [1,2,3,4,7] - uniques in A
        [1,2,5,6,8] - uniques in B
      var result = [];

      A = [1,1,2,2,3,4,7,7,7]
      B = [1,2,5,5,5,6,8]

      result = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
      var i=0, j=0;
      var result = [], elem;
      while(i<A.length || j<B.length) {
        //1. if both elements are same
        if(A[i] === B[j]) {
          elem = result.pop();
          if(A[i] !== elem) {
            result.push(elem);
          }
          i++;
          j++;
        }

        //2. if A elem smaller than B elem

        else if(A[i] < B[j]) {
          //add smaller element, again if it's not present in the result array

        }


      }
