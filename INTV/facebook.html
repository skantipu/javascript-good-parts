//            Practice Problem:  This example is the same as the one provided prior to our coding challenge,
//            however; I wanted to provide it to you again as a refresher.
//
//            Q: Write a function that takes a number n and returns an array containing a Fibonacci sequence of length n
//
//            A simple solution (horribly inefficient):

            function fib(n) {
                if (n <= 1) return 1;
                return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
            }
            function fibArray(n) {
                let arr = [];
                for (let x=0; x<n; x++) {
                    arr.push(fib(x));
                }
                return arr;
            }

            console.log(fibArray2(30));
//            Time Complexity: O(n*2^n)
//            Space Complexity: O(n)
//            So, how do we improve? Memoize the recursive function so we don't keep recomputing the same values:
            function fibArray1(n) {
                let fibMemo = new Map();
                function fib(n) {
                    if (fibMemo.has(n)) return fibMemo.get(n);
                    if (n <= 1) return 1;
                    const result = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
                    fibMemo.set(n, result);
                    return result;
                }
                let arr = [];
                for (let x=0; x<n; x++) {
                    arr.push(fib(x));
                }
                return arr;
            }
//            Time Complexity: O(n)
//            Space Complexity: O(n)
//            Not bad, but the memoization is really overkill. We could write this cleaner by using the previous values as we build the array:
              function fibArray2(n) {
                  let arr = [];
                  for (let x=0; x<n; x++) {
                      arr.push(
                        x < 2 ? 1 : arr[x - 1] + arr[x - 2]
                      );
                  }
                  return arr;
              }
//            Things to keep in mind:
//            • Follow instructions
//            • Does your code always return an array?
//            • Is it always of length n?
//            • Know the time and space complexity of the code you write
//            • Handle edge cases. What if n is zero?
//            • Test your code! Walk through a sample input

                2. A json is given with list of objects having image url property and height (assume same width for all images)
                   You need to invoke all the images at the given urls, and render them as shown in the pic. Follow three column layout. After rendering first three
                   side by side, then the fourth goes underneath the image whichever has least height. Follow this pattern for rest of the images.
