<!--
1. Prepare a webpage which (on button click) can load a specified text json file(attached), display the text.  Remove punctuation and make all letters lower case.  Count frequency of each token and display list of words by their frequency.  Support the same for 2-grams, 3-grams, etc.

2. Next, using either the results of your previous exercise, or one of these json words files, display a word cloud of phrases with weight randomly assigned or based on frequency in the text.

3. Make a new web page which shows a simple rectangle (maybe a bordered div).  Clicking in the rectangle should cause 2 new rectangles to appear inside, either vertical or horizontal.  Each new rectangle should support similar click behavior.
