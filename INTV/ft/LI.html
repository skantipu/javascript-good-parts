    1. accordion (accessibility)
    2. calendar (js) - should have code for greying out days of prev and next month in my current month's calendar
    3. conversion of number to words -
      231 - two hundred and thirty one and 00/100
      231.23 - two hundred and thirty one and twenty three/100
    4. Design/Architecture round: Show new users popping up as pointers on the visible area of globe. Globe say finishes revolution in 1 hr.
      ajax call and update UI
      what if real time data I need?? -- web sockets (no multiple ajax calls here, session: keep-alive (outdated way of handling sessions)).
      scalability - what if new user sing up rate explodes -- how to efficiently show it on UI (aggregation by city)
    5. Product technical taste - name a product and what u like and what u dont like and how you can improve (flipkart lite - progressive app)

    --------------------
    aabcabad - construct a char freq map and construct a tree from it.
    {
      a: 4,
      b: 2,
      c: 1,
      d: 1
    }

    sorted map {d: 1, c: 1, b: 2, a: 4}

         8
               4
                   2
     a4    b2  c:1    d:1

     start with d:1, nodify it (create object), then left child is c:1, and once you have right and left set, set parent 2 (sum of 1, 1).
     Now get left child b:2, now left child is b:2, right child is 2 (sum node), and set parent 4.
     setParent(a:4, 4) -- 8 ....

     function nodify() {..}
     function setParent(left, right){..}
     function treeify(){...}

     hotel management system design (reserve, book use cases, how to handle concurrent user booking at same time? etc)
     ------------------
     implement webpack like
     read files and filter for lines starting with import and extract the filepath from it. now go to that file path and do the same. finally print all file
     paths starting from bottom. if a file does not have any import, return file name
     used node js file methods.

     import {} from 'filepath'

     const emitter = new Emitter();
     // 1. Support subscribing to events.
     const sub = emitter.subscribe('event_name', callback);

     // 2. Support emitting events.
     // This particular example should lead to the callback above being invoked with foo and bar as parameters.
     emitter.emit('event_name', 'foo', 'bar');

     // 3. Support unsubscribing existing subscriptions by releasing them.
     sub.release(); // sub is the reference returned by subscribe above
    -----------------
     var store = new DOMStore();
     // node is an HTML node (in javascript, it's an object)
     store.get(node); //returns value
     store.set(node, store.get(node)+1);
     store.set(node, 3);
     store.has(node); //true/false

     object cannot have another another as a key. key has to be a string or symbol. (Look at Map, which allows object as a key)

     so since node is an object, store a uniquely generated value as a property on the object and fetch node using that property.
