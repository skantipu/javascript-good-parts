It uses Webpack 4 + Babel 7 + React 16
Ref: https://www.valentinog.com/blog/webpack-tutorial/
With webpack4, no need to mention entry and output files.
Default entry -> ./src/index.js
Default output -> ./dist/main.js
webpack 4 introduces production (npm run build) and development (npm run dev) modes. After ran, bundle will be in ./dist/main.js.
Production mode enables all sorts of optimizations out of the box. Including minification, scope hoisting, tree-shaking and more
Remember for local development, make sure index.html point to main.js and not dist/main.js. The former has always latest copy of your local changes.
It uses SASS preprocessor for CSS. Needed loaders included in webpack.config.js
