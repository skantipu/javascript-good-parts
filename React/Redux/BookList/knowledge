Redux serves to construct application state and React provides the views to display that state. The two libraries are inherently disconnected and only through
use of React-Redux, we can get clear connection between the two.

Reducer
    Our application state is generated by reducer function, so it's basically a function returning application state.
    we have different reducers for various pieces of application state.
    reducer function return value of the state (in a js object)
Container
    A component promoted as container that is aware of the state contained in the Redux.
