Component or View
	snippets of JS code producing HTML. collection of JS functions producing HTML.

JSX 	A subset or dialect of JS which lets us write HTML inside JS. Webpack and babel, transpires this JSX into vanilla JS which produce HTML.

React vs React DOM
	react creates and manages components whereas react-dom deals with rendering them in DOM.

-> instantiate your components before you render them to the DOM
-> using a tag (app is a type or class) <app /> (self closing tag - when you have a tag with no content in  it - <app></app>) inside JSX will instantiate it
-> always one component per file

Functional based component vs class based component: Whenever component needs to be aware of its state and communicate with other components —> we use class based component. Class based component should have render() and it should return JSX.

State
	Plain JS object that exists on any class based component. Each instance of class based component has its own copy of state (functional components do not have state).  whenever component state changes, it immediately re-renders and forces its children (components nested inside it) to re-render as well. Before we use state inside a component, we need to initialize state first. We initialize state as:
class SearchBar extends React.component {
	constructor (props) {
		super(props);
		this.state = {…}
	}
	render() {
		return (
			<div> Hello World! </div>
		);
	}
}

Manipulating state: Only inside constructor(), we’ll have something like this.state = {}. Everywhere else,  we’ll use this.setState() to modify state.
ex: Let’s say we initialized state as
class SearchBar extends React.component {
constructor (props) {
	super(props);
	this.state = { term: ‘’};
}
render() {
	return (
		<input onChange = {this.onInputChange} />
		<span> Value of Input: {this.state.term} </span>
	);
}
onInputChange(event) {
		this.state.term = event.target.value; // BAD!!!! DON’T DO IT
	        this.setState( { term: event.target.value }); // GOOD!!
		// while setting always use setState(), but while getting, you can use this.state.term
}
}

Downward dataflow: Most parent component should be responsible for fetching data.

Passing data from parent component to child component: by passing as a property (passing props)

Passing data from child component to parent component: by passing callbacks from parent to child

Stay away from JS 'for' loop in JSX. Use built-in iterators (map ex.)

REDUX:

 - refers to application level global state (data of our app)
 Redux serves to construct application state and React provides the views to display that state. The two libraries are inherently disconnected and only through
 use of React-Redux, we can get clear connection between the two.

 Reducer
     Our application state is generated by reducer function, so it's basically a function returning application state.
     we have different reducers for various pieces of application state.
     reducer function return value of the state (in a js object)
 Container
     A component promoted as container that is aware of the state contained in the Redux.
