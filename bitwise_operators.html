       General Trivia:

       Number object overrides toString() to return string representation of number in specified base.
       (12).toString(2) -- return 12 in binary form = "1100"
       (12).toString(2) -- return hexadecimal representation of 12 = "c"


      1) even and odd check

      number & 1 == 0 for even, number & 1 == 1 for odd
      so even check would be (number & 1) == 0

      2)
