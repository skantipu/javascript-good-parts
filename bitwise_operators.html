    /*
    Uses:
    - in memory and CPU constrained environments, bitwise operators help as they occupy less space and execute faster.
    Drawbacks:
    - Readability

       General Trivia:

       Number object overrides toString() to return string representation of number in specified base.
       (12).toString(2) -- return 12 in binary form = "1100"
       (12).toString(2) -- return hexadecimal representation of 12 = "c"

       3 << 2 -- add 2 0's at the end of binary representation of 3.
       So 3 is 0011. 3 << 2 will be 001100, which is 12.
       3 * 2^2 = 12

       6 << 3 will be 0110 with three zeros added right most -> 0110000 = 48
       6 * 2^3 = 48


      1) even and odd check

      number & 1 == 0 for even, number & 1 == 1 for odd
      so even check would be (number & 1) == 0

      2) Math.floor = ~~ (double negation)
